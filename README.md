For my midterm project in Semester 4, I created a Snooker Game using JS.p5 and matter.js. The game features a snooker table with realistic ball movement. Balls can be drawn in three modes: starting positions (keystroke "1"), random positions with reds only (keystroke "2"), and random positions with reds and colored balls (keystroke "3"), excluding the cue ball. I also implemented an extension mode (keystroke "4") with gravity pockets that randomly attract or repel balls. The game design and implementation were discussed in a commentary and video.
